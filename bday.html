Within an hour, I had successfully exported and converted all his notes into individual, organized documents accessible right from his PC! 💻 No more switching between devices or struggling with tiny mobile screens. It was validation that these skills can make a genuine difference in people's lives, even in seemingly small ways."

Those lyrics reflect the cornerstone of my approach to business and life. It underscored the undeniable power of networking, collaboration, and leveraging the strengths of others. We aren't omnipotent beings; recognizing our limitations and seeking complementary skills is not a weakness, but a strategic advantage. For a long time, I operated as a lone wolf, priding myself on individual execution. Scaling alone, however, is a tough climb, and the constant pressure can stifle creativity."

(Sends me a VN of the client's response, I listened and I would not lie I was a little pissed. Even if you are not happy, you should not water down someone's effort na). I wore my professionalism cap and responded politely. I asked for specific areas they wanted corrected etc.

After sometime...

Contact: He agreed to present it first to the reviewer and just come back with the feedback.

Some days later...

JJL: How about the review, what was said?

Contact: The reviewer loved the analysis, and said it was great no changes to be made.

In my mind I was like, I'm still good at what I do 💃💃💃☺️.`

Integrity is not just about being honest, it's about being reliable and consistent. It's about doing what you say you'll do, when you say you'll do it.

Focus on fundamentals over frameworks. Learn to learn effectively. Build public projects that demonstrate your capabilities. Cultivate communication skills as much as technical ones.

To damage your ignorance ask questions. 3. Don't defend your ignorance. You don't cast out ignorance in the name of Jesus, knowledge casts out ignorance."

          content: "Earlier on when I started software development, I would priotize getting the job done, not carrying anyone along, just showing up with solutions that worked but no one understood it and how I got it. I even had a round table team meeting held because of me once, where everyone on the team where airing their displeasure about my work style and felt left out. I was so focused on the code that I neglected the people. I learned that communication is as important as coding. It's not just about writing code; it's about writing code that others can understand and maintain. It's about collaborating with your team, sharing knowledge, and building relationships. Communication is the key to success in any field, especially in tech."
